Project description 
4.1. Train
	We’ve run the model with initialized weights for 200 epochs, then we repeat that for 4 times by passing the best.pt best weight 
	file of each last model. Till the message of no improvement appears, this is the reason I’ve changed the patience parameter to be 300.
	That sixth model (eva6) gave the best results on validation and was the most accurate one. That’s why there’re 6 eva files in runs/train.
	What I did gives the epochs a room to learn from each others not sequentially but as a block. Like using the best of all. 

4.2. Detect
	I tested both model 5 and 6 on test set and I tried both of best and last weight files are there. 
	That’s why there’re 4 eva file in runs/detect. The best is in file eva.

	Best Results --> model6 and last weight (last.pt) (runs/detect/eva) 

4.3. IOU.py
	There’s an IOU.py file has three function:
	1. txtData :
		Parameters --> xywh of both true and predicated one label  
		Return--> ordered pair of left top and right bottom points of both parameters, and calculated area of both shapes. 

	2. areaInter:
		Parameters  that returned ordered pair to calculate the area interaction
		Return  area interaction

	3. IOU 
	s	Parameters  area of both and area intersection
		Return  Intersection/ Union
